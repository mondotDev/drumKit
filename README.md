Wes Bos 30 Day, Project 1


Returning to code after a sizable hiatus. Bottom line is that I keep thinking about code, projects, solving problems.. This is what I am supposed to be doing. So I begin again, and Wes Bos' walkthroughs have served me well in the past.

## Day 1
    - Set up accounts on github, and hashnode for blogging
    - Grabbed new url mondot.dev
    - Pulled VS Code from the mothballs and got everything synced
    - Added code base for project
    - Push this thing and start the green square journey

## Day 2
    - Video and notes for project. Break into code tomorrow

## Day 3
    - Today I got the sound working with the keydown listener. It feels good to see something happening because of code I have written out.
